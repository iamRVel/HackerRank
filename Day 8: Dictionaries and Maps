# Task 

# Given n names and phone numbers, assemble a phone book that maps friends names to their respective phone numbers. You will then be

# given an unknown number of names to query your phone book for; for each query, print the associated entry from your phone book (in the form name = phoneNumber) or Not found if there is no entry for name.

# given an unknown number of names to query your phone book for; for each queried, print the associated entry from your phone book (in

# the form name = phoneNumber) or Not found if there is no entry for name.

# Note: Your phone book should be a Dictionary/Map/HashMap data structure.

# Input Format
# The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of entries in the phone book. Each of the n subsequent lines describes an entry in the form of 2 space-separated values on a single line. The first value is a friend's name, and the second value is an 8-digit phone number.
# Each of the n subsequent lines describes an entry in the form of 2 space-separated values on a single line. The first value is a
# friend's name, and the second value is an 8-digit phone number.

# After the N lines of phone book entries, there are an unknown number of lines of queries. Each line (query) contains a name to look up,
# and you must continue reading lines until there is no more input.
# After the N lines of phone book entries, there are an unknown number of lines of queries. Each line (query) contains a name to look
# up, and you must continue reading lines until there is no more input.

# Note: Names consist of lowercase English letters and are first names only.


# Output Format
# On a new line for each query, print Not found if the name has no corresponding entry in the phone book; otherwise, print the full name
# and phoneNumber in the format name = phoneNumber.
# On a new line for each query, print Not found if the name has no corresponding entry in the phone book; otherwise, print the full
# name and phoneNumber in the format name = phoneNumber.

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
