# Day 7: Arrays

# Task 
# Given an array, A, of N integers, print A's elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

# Input Format
# The first line contains an integer, N (the size of our array). 
# The second line contains N space-separated integers describing array A's elements.

# Constraints
# 1 <= N <= 1000
# 1 <= Ai <= 10000, where Ai is the ith integer in the array

# Output Format
# Print the elements of array A in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.
